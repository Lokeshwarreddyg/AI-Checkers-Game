# AI-Checkers-Game
### Checkers AI Game Overview
This repository features a Checkers game designed to pit a human player against an AI. The AI utilizes two distinct algorithms—Minimax and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)—to navigate the game based on heuristic conditions derived from the game state.

### Game Dynamics
Player vs. AI: Engage in strategic gameplay against an advanced AI opponent that adjusts its tactics based on the current situation.
Algorithm Selection: The AI selects its strategy according to the complexity of the game state:
•	Minimax: Deployed when the game state is less complex, allowing for a deep and deterministic analysis of potential moves.
•	Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): Used in more complex scenarios where the game state contains a larger number of possible moves, enabling the AI to explore a wide array of outcomes probabilistically.

### Objective
The primary goal is to provide a challenging and educational experience that showcases how different AI algorithms can be applied to classical board games. This project not only demonstrates the capabilities of each algorithm in making strategic decisions but also offers insights into their application in real-world scenarios where decision-making under uncertainty is crucial.
